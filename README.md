A two-stage predictive machine learning engine that forecasts the on-time performance of flights for 15 different airports in the USA based on data collected between 2016 and 2017.

Flights are said to be delayed when they arrive later than the scheduled arrival time. This delay is predominantly influenced by environmental conditions. Flight delay is vexatious for passengers and also incurs an agonizingly high financial loss to airlines and countries. A structured prediction system is an indispensable tool to help aviation authorities effectively alleviate flight delays. This project aims to build a two-stage machine learning engine to effectively predict the arrival delay of a flight in minutes after departure based on real-time flight and weather data. A classifier first predicts if the flight will be delayed or not, and subsequently a regression model predicts the arrival delay in minutes if the flight is expected to be delayed.
